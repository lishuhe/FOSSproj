**This is my "capstone" for the FOSS 2023 course.**

Here, I'm just putting down random words to follow along the tutorial for the FOSS 2023 Fall Documentation and Communication class. :fontawesome-regular-face-laugh-wink:

But anyway...

A high school dropout turned ambitious young scientist, I am currently a fifth-year PhD student pursuing a degree in Physiology. When I'm not in the lab, I love indulging my love for books, working my way through recipes, as well as doing small film projects with my beloved DSLR camera.
