# The FOSS Project

This GitHub page is my "capstone" for the [FOSS 2023 course](https://foss.cyverse.org/).

## Objective of the FOSS capstone

The goal is to provide FOSS learners with an idea of what a well constructed GitHub repository should look like.

Throughout FOSS, learners will be given the opportunity to reinforce their knowledge through self-paced assignments: a novel topic will be covered each week, and at the end of the lesson learners will be asked to add their newly gained knowledge to their own GitHub repository. This repository aims to be a reference learners can use when adding to their own work.

## Structure

This repository aims to represent a well structured page for a research tool following [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5da9f4479ecab221ce848fb2/1571419335217/CARE+Principles_One+Pagers+FINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) principles. In addition, the resporitory tries to follow best practices for project management, data management, version control and documentation with the goal of being reproducible for collaborators and potential contributors.

Each of the aims discussed above are associated with their specific FOSS lessons:

- [Project Management](https://foss.cyverse.org/02_project_management/)
- [Managing Data](https://foss.cyverse.org/03_managing_data/)
- [Documentation and Communication](https://foss.cyverse.org/04_documentation_communication/)
- [Version Control](https://foss.cyverse.org/05_version_control/)
- [Reproducibility](https://foss.cyverse.org/06_reproducibility_i/)
